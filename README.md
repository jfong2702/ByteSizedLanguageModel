# Genetic Algorithm Trained Language Model with NEAT-Python

## Overview

This repository contains a language model trained using a genetic algorithm implemented with the `neat-python` library. The model is designed to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on the patterns it learns from the training data. By leveraging the principles of evolutionary algorithms, the model evolves over generations to improve its performance in language generation tasks.

## Features

- **NEAT-Python Integration**: Utilizes the `neat-python` library for implementing the genetic algorithm, allowing for efficient evolution and adaptation of the language model.
  
- **Language Generation**: Capable of generating text based on the learned patterns from the training data, producing coherent and contextually relevant sentences.

- **Customizable**: The model can be fine-tuned and adapted to different text corpora and language styles, providing flexibility in language generation tasks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `neat-python` library
